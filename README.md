# Konrad Group Code Test

### Description of solution
Sure, I could have used a framework like Angular or libraries such as React,
jQuery, ect., but I chose to go vanilla JS. Why? To show my understanding of the
language as well as my understanding of the React framework.

My vanilla JS solution performs similar to the way React does. True, it has no
lifecycles but each component class has a render() method. The return value of
the render method is a String representation of a DOM object, and is injected as
HTML.

### Dependencies
- none

\*other than the browser needing to be able to compile ES6 javascript classes.
